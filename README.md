# ðŸ”¢ NumberGuesser
A simple number-guessing game in your browser.

## How does it work?
It's a simple game that will draw a number to guess, a player has 3 lives at the start and with every correct answer, the player gets additional life and point. When a player is wrong the life is taken but the number to guess stays the same. The game ends when a player is out of all lives.

There are 3 difficulty levels, and with 5 correct answers, a player will get to the next level. A player's goal is to get as many points as he can.
